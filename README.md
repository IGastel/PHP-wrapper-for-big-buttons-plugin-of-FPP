wrapper for the big-buttons plugin of FPP.
this wrapper is intended for use with a touchscreen connected to a raspberry pi.
this wrapper shows a overlay which is disables with a tap on the screen.
this was made because, when the screen goes into sleep mode, any tap to wake up the screen would also trigger an action of teh big button plugin.
the overlay prevents this, as it captures the first tap.

this file must be saved in: /opt/fpp/www/bb-wrapper.html
the link for the kiosk mode is: http://localhost/bb-wrapper.html
